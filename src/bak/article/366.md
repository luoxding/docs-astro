title: What Are Inductors? 什么是电感？
---

Let's talk a peek into inductors.

一起研究一下什么是电感。

## Why Should I Care? 为啥电感很有用？
Inductors are less mentioned than capacitors and resistors. But They are especially important if you want to do sth with AC, that is alternating current. Inductors are like the resistors in the AC world. They oppose the change in current. So they can be used to filter signals or transforming between different AC voltages.

电子爱好者提到电感的次数明显比电容和电阻要少。但是如果你想用交流电来做某事，它们就特别重要。电感就像交流世界中的电阻。他们反对改变电流。因此它们可用于过滤信号或在不同的交流电压之间进行转换。

## What Is a Inductor? 电感长什么样子？
An inductor is as simple physically as any electronic component. It is just a coil of wire around a magnetic or non-magnetic stick. 

电感在物理上与任何电子元件一样简单。它只是一个围绕磁性或非磁性棒的线圈。

Just a coil of wire can do very interesting things due to the magnetic properties of the coil. Because of Faraday's Laws of Induction, when an electric current is passed through the coil of wire a magnetic field is created this magnetic field can actually store the electric current for a short period of time even its supply is cut off. Just like capacitors can store charge. Inductors can store magnetic fields, which can provide current.

由于线圈的电磁特性，它就可以做非常有趣的事情。由于法拉第感应定律，当电流通过线圈时会产生磁场，该磁场实际上可以在短时间内存储电流，即使其电源被切断。就像电容器可以储存电荷一样。电感器可以存储磁场，可以提供电流。

## Inductance 电感值

Depends on:

取决于：

- Number of turns of the coil
- Material (Magnetic?)
- Length of the coil

- 线圈的匝数
- 材料（磁性？）
- 线圈长度

The inductance of inductors in series adds together just like resistors.

电感串联，电感值等于各自电感值相加，跟电阻规律一直。

```
L1 + L2 = Ltotal
```

Inductors connected in parallel the total inductance is going to be less than each individual inductor. 

并联的电感器的总电感量将小于每个单独的电感器。

```
Ltotal = 1/(1/L1 + 1/L2)
```

Also same as what we have for resistors.

也是跟电阻并联的计算公式一致。

## End

OK, I think that's all we need to know about inductors for now.

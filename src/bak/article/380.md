title: Quantified self 量化生活
---

Quantified self refers to self-tracking with technology, with the aim to gain "self-knowledge through numbers", in order to improve physical, mental, and emotional performance. 

量化生活指的是用技术追踪身体的各项指标，目的是通过数据对自己的健康状况有全面的认识。以便达到提升身体和情绪表现的目的。

The widespread adoption in recent years of wearable fitness and sleep trackers such as the Fitbit or the Apple Watch have made self-tracking accessible to many of us today.

最近几年很多人都购买了 Fitbit 手环或者苹果手表这样的可穿戴设备，让追踪数据变得非常方便了。

## History

The term quantified self appears to have been proposed in San Francisco by Wired magazine editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly in 2007 。

量化生活这个词是2007年的时候，有咱们国内大家都非常熟悉的连线杂志主编凯文凯利，和他的一位同事沃尔夫共同提出的。

## Methodologies

The primary method is the collection and analysis of data. In many cases, data are collected automatically using wearable sensors, not limited to, but often worn on the wrist. In other cases, data may be logged manually.

最重要的肯定是要收集和分析数据了。很多情况下，数据都是用可穿戴设备上的传感器自动收集的。最常见的设备就是手环手表，但是也不局限于这些设备。另外，数据必要时也可以用手动记录。

Technology has made it easier and simpler to gather and analyze personal data. Since these technologies have become smaller and cheaper to be put in smart phones or tablets, it is easier to take the quantitative methods used in science and business and apply them to the personal sphere.

技术在不断进步，收集数据变得越来越容易了。手机和其他设备变得越来越便宜，这些设备里面植入一些传感器后也不会太贵，原来只能用医院的专业设备采集的数据，也可以用自己的设备来采集了。

## Applications

A major application of quantified self has been in health and wellness improvement. Many devices and services help with tracking physical activity, caloric intake, sleep quality, posture, and other factors involved in personal well-being. Corporate wellness programs, for example, will often encourage some form of tracking. Genetic testing and other services have also become popular.

数据到手，最重要的用途可是用来分析然后给出提升我们健康水平的建议。通常我们需要的数据是，碳水摄入量，睡眠质量，姿势，运动量。如果去医院，他们可能会要求你用他们的设备采集更多种类的数据，比如动态心电图。基因测序现在也越来越便宜了。

## End

I personally have faith in AI and big data, and am now tracking my life as much as possible.

我自己对大数据和 AI 有着一种信仰，所以我平时会尽力的去记录生活和身体的各项数据。

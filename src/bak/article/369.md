## Linux and Him

He was important for the birth of Linux.

NO.1 he programmed the GCC, which is a free C programming language compiler that Linus Torvalds used later to build Linux operating system.

NO.2 he started GNU operating system, and build lots of important software that later been used on Linux.

NO.3 Stallman was the author of the GPL license and pioneered the concept of copyleft. GPL, General Public License, is the important open-source software license that has ever been issued. Linux was released under this license, which makes it easy for the global hackers to help Linus to build Linux with the faith that Linux would forever be free for the world to use.
